Performed data cleaning & EDA.

Trained classification models with feature selection & hyperparameter tuning.

Deployed a Streamlit web app.

Achieved 85% accuracy with XGBoost.

Identified key churn drivers.

Feedback:

Great example of a full pipeline from raw data to deployment.

Add specifics in interviews: e.g., how you selected features, which tuning methods you used (GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV?), and how business stakeholders used the Streamlit app.

If available, mention SHAP or feature importance techniques used to identify key churn drivers.
